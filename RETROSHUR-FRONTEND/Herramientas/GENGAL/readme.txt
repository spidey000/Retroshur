A gamelist.xml generator for EmulationStation

-----===================================------

Requirements
	Windows 7 or above with Windows Management Framework v5 installed

-----===================================------

How to use
	1. Run Gengal
	2. Click Browse to locate your ROM folder. Gengal currently operates on all files in this folder.
	   If you have any bin/cue files, please remove the items you do NOT want to see in the ES menus
	   before continuing. Once Gengal has generated the XML file, you can put them back.
	3. Select the fields you want to include for all games. Image, Marquee and Video.
		You should also set the extension and subfolder for each. For example, if your images are
		in JPG format, change the default '.png' extension to '.jpg'
	4. Click Preview to see if the layout is correct
	5. Click Generate when ready

If you make a mistake, don't worry. You can change the settings and Gengal will just update the
gamelist.xml file if you point it to the same ROM folder. If you add games however, you will need to
regenerate the whole file again as at this point Gengal cannot add new games into the file.
