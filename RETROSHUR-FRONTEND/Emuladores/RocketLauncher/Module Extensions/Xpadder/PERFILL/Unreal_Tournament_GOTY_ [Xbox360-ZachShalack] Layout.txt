It's important to play around with the look sensitivity on the game. I play with it around 3.00 which is default but a lot of the input options can severely decrease the sensitivity in the game. Play around with the number till you feel comfortable. Also, only the basic buttons are mapped so map out the rest of the controller however you see fit. I suggest using the D-pad for your favorite weapon shortcuts, and putting a toggle crouch on one of the thumb stick clicks.
