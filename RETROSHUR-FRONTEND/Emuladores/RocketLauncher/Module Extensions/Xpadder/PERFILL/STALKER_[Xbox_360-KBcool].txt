S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Shadow of Chernobyl

        Xpadder Profile 1.0
  (For the XBOX 360(R) Controller)

	    By KBcool





Thank you for your interest. This is the
first profile I've done and it's not as 
finished as I would like. This may not be the 
best way to use the a controller with S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
,though it's the most comfortable for me.
I hope you enjoy using this profile as 
much as I have.

[Installation]

1.} Place the 2 files in a location of your choice
    (I keep my profiles and controller files with my Xpadder program in a folder)

2.} Open Xpadder v2007.11a or higher and click on the profile button, then Open,
     and browse to the location of the files you just placed. Finally,
     click on the file named "STALKER [XBOX 360 Controller - KBcool].xpadderprofile"
     and then click open.

3.} Minimize Xpadder, Startup S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and enjoy.
