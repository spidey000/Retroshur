! bug fixed

v1.1.8 - 2016-03-03
    + Added right-click menu option to exit all open Frameless windows.
      (Thanks, B. Berry)
    + Added "noresize=yes" option to disable resizing the image with the mouse.
      (Thanks, B. Berry)

v1.1.7 - 2014-11-09
    ! With some Windows themes, a border would appear along the bottom and right
      edges of the image.  (Thanks, lanux128 & Alex N.)

v1.1.6 - 2014-10-11
    + Added "noactivate=yes" option to show an image without activating the
      window and taking focus.  (Thanks, lanux128)

v1.1.5 - 2014-10-10
    + Images are now resizable.  This excludes GIF files and files where the
      "trans=alpha" parameter are in effect.  Holding down the shift key while
      resizing keeps the image's aspect ratio.  (Thanks, B. Johnson)

v1.1.4 - 2014-08-24
    ! Images sizes weren't reset when using the hotkeys to navigate a folder of
      images.  (Thanks, Ed)

v1.1.3 - 2014-08-12
    + Added option to use PNG alpha transparency.  Use trans="alpha" to take
      advantage of this feature.  (Thanks, Adam B.)

v1.1.2 - 2013-12-20
    ! Frameless errored out if x/y values were not specified.  Default x/y
      values are now zero (0).  (Thanks, Attila)

v1.1.1 - 2013-11-03
    + Added "fullscreen=yes" option.  (Thanks, Will G.)
    + Added "w" and "h" options.  (Thanks, Will G.)

v1.1.0 - 2013-08-17
    * When advancing through a directory, the original X/Y anchors will be
      used.  (Thanks, M. Hoopes)

v1.0.9 - 2013-02-03
    + Added aob=yes parameter to display an image at the bottom of the z-order.
      (Thanks, joeyT)
    + Added update check to the image context menu.

v1.0.8 - 2012-11-14
    + Added noexit=yes parameter.  Setting this will remove the "Exit" entry
      from the context menu and prevent the Alt+F4 and Escape hotkeys from
      exiting the application.  However, you can still kill Frameless via the
      Task Manager.  (Thanks, Jon)

v1.0.7 - 2012-02-03
    + Space/Backspace will now show the next/previous image in the folder.  The
      PageUp and PageDown keys will also work.  (Thanks, Sean)
    + Support for animated gifs provided by the AniGIF control from Antonis
      Kyprianou of http://www.winasm.net. 

v1.0.6 - 2011-09-09
    + Added ability to use L, C, or R for the "x" coordinate and T, C, or B for
      the "y" coordinate.  This corresponds to Left, Center and Right for "x"
      and Top, Center and Bottom for "y."  For instance, you can now use these
      options to automtically position an image in the bottom right corner or
      to center an image on your screen.  (Thanks, WillieCee)
    + Added "mon" parameter for use with the above L/C/R and T/C/B options. 
      This will allow you to specify which monitor to position the image on
      e.g., c:\path\to\Frameless.exe "c:\path\to\image.jpg" x=C y=C mon=2
      It has no effect if you manually specify the "x" or "y" coordinates.

v1.0.5 - 2011-06-25
    + Added "aot" parameter to set window as Always On Top e.g. aot=yes

v1.0.4 - 2011-06-24
    + Added "trans" parameter.  Valid values are 0-255.  (Thanks, pilgrim)
    + Added "caption" parameter.  (Thanks, R. Christy)
    + Added hotkeys to move the window around.  (Thanks, R. Christy)
        # Up/down/left/right arrow keys will move it one pixel at a time.
        # Shift + up/down/left/right arrow keys will move it ten pixels at a
          time.
    + Added new context menu item: Show size & position data
    - Regressed PNG transparency support added in v1.0.3 for now.  Sorry.

v1.0.3 - 2011-06-23
    + Handles transparency in PNG files now.  (Thanks, pilgrim)

v1.0.2 - 2011-06-17
    + Added "duration" parameter.  Use standard timestamp format e.g. hh:mm:ss. 
      (Thanks, pilgrim)
