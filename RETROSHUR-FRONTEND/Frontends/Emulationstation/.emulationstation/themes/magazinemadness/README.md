# es-theme-magazinemadness

OVERVIEW

This is an Emulation Station theme for RetroPie.
 
The theme uses a horizontal carousel for system selection using magazine covers as the system wheels.  Once a system is selected, the game selection screen is an open magazine for the selected system.

1. supports over 80 systems
2. supports video snaps
3. supports marquees

 This theme uses some zIndex layering for the video snaps.  There is a known issue within Emulation Station when you have the OMX Player enabled so make sure to turn it off.
